# LeetCode & DSA Practice 🚀

This repository contains my **daily LeetCode problem solutions** and **notes from studying Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)**.  
The main goals of this repo are:

- 🧠 Improve problem-solving and algorithmic thinking  
- 📚 Stay consistent with DSA learning  
- 💻 Track progress through clean, organized solutions  
- 📈 Build a strong foundation for technical interviews
